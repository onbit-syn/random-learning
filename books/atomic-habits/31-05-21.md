### Atomic Habits Last day

**What habits make some people successful others not?**

* First everyone need to build good habits to become successful but building any habit requires coping with boredom. How better you cope with boredom is the way you become good.
* David Cain, an author and meditation teacher encourages his students to avoid being "fair-weather meditators".

**Review and reflect habits**

* Review and reflect on how you are growing is very important. A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote.

***

* Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.
* Happiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming.
* Being curious is better than being smart. Being motivated and curious counts for more than being smart because it leads to action.

A good book everyone should read it.
